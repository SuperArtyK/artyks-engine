Contains list of things to do later




to fix in engine:
AEKeyboard::GetPressedKeys() -- very bad and slow implementation in my opinion


to implement:
some kind of exit procedure to kill all modules, without the separate scanning thread for each of them.
exit codes on closing applications
graphics engine, to write to screen fast;
sound player, to play audio, probably ogg
sound synthesizer, to generate oldschool sound
