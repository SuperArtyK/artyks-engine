v0.0.6

Global stuff:

AEKeyboard:
Added "m_keyid" (smalluint) and "m_name" (const char*) to sKeyState(struct)
Added new flags to consturctor, Refer to docs.
Added separate functions to get state of the key
Changed all keyid related functions to "smalluint" to be in always bounds and fast
Added delay between keyscans
Sleeps for frame if we window is not active
Now inherits from __AEBaseClass, Refer to docs
Added mouse scanning support


AELog:
Moved LOG_ defines to log.hpp
No more changing paths during object runtime :/
Fixed bug that crashes the program if use Filelog::writetolog() (which made it practically useless)
Added addtologqueue() which behaves exactly like writetolog() but doesn't call "startthread". Good for entries before logger starts
Added new flags to consturctor, Refer to docs.
Changed m_ldEntrycount (double) to m_ullEntrycount (uint64_t)
Added support for temp files, but they affect performance a lot
Balanced writing to log, now writetolog pregenerates string, and mainthread just writes and erases string
Removed vectorcheck()
Fixed bug that results in empty/corrupted module and/or message in log
Moved checking log type (eg. LOG_INFO) to separate function
Added engine start log entry
Removed getVectorSize()
Removed openfile_tmp()
Removed closefile_tmp()
Removed cleanup_vectors()
Removed the mainthread() completely, as it adds unnesesary overhead

Removed addtologqueue()
Changed access of stoplogging() and startlogging() to private
Moved logdate() to artyk:: namespace in func_utils.hpp




AEScreen:
Reworked class
Added proper constructors and destructors
Optimized stuff, and made boundaries
Fixed setScreenSize to correctly set screen size
Renamed setScreenSize to setScreen
Added new flags to consturctor, Refer to docs.
Now inherits from __AEBaseClass, Refer to docs



AESound:
Removed global variables
Added new flags to consturctor, Refer to docs.
Now inherits from __AEBaseClass, Refer to docs.
Rewrote so it doesnt use AFX


Global stuff:
Renamed to AE[name] so user can differentiate ArtyK's engine and other modules
Made all global variables(global_vars.hpp) constant or inlined
Added "artyk" namespace for global variables and functions
Added color codes(artyk::color::) for Screen module
Added license and github info to files
Removed "moved from" comments
Changed "include.hpp" to needed header files in all header/source files(except main file, myengine.cpp)
Changed "using namespace std" to needed "using"s
Added cpu-friendly delay AEFrame
Added generated-on-startup full app name (app_name_full)
Added key names and id's to the map, and made id's numerical
Removed "log_keywords[100][2]"
Added global timer
Moved currentDateTime() to func_utils.hpp
Added timecounter(bool) as experimental
Added fixCinInput()
Added isnum(const std::string&)
Splitted findinstr to findinstr_pos() and findinstr_text()
Splitted strtolower() to tolower_ref() and tolower_val()
Added module name and "serial number" for each of modules. Now you can identify them during runtime.
Added debug log entries for modules that use filelog
Made code a little faster
Moved files to appropriate folders and filters(in vs)
AEScreen, Beep, and Keyboard are now inherited from __AEBaseClass, which has built-in logger support
Added syncronization functions, depends on timer(global timer by default) time (TIMER_WAIT macro)
GAME_FPS is now 66 instead of 60
Removed logger's thread after testing it, gives unnesesary overhead
Removed AEScreen's focus scan thread and moved to "main" function, don't touch code surrounded with "don't touch" comments
Added documentation

Cutted unnesesary stuff out and changed stuff, still don't remember everything, see this update as full engine refactoring.
