/** @file include/engine/AEFrame.hpp

 *  Useful if you need to limit the execution time of the program. It makes

 *  processed faster than you need.

 *  Should not cause everything to break.

 //usage:
 // create obj AEFrame with fps value
 // AEFrame fr(30); -- creates frame_rater fr with 30fps delays
 //
 // after your stuff is done, call frame_rater::sleep();
 //	while(true) {
 //		std::cout << "Hello world\n";
 //		fr.sleep();
 //	}
 // it outputs "Hello world" and waits the rest of time of 30fps delay(cout delay+rest = 0.0333...)
 //
 // also you can change framerate on the fly with AEFrame::setfps(float myfps)

 /// \brief This module is used for creating delays(in FPS format) in the engine.
 /// It is great if used in loops, as it makes them have delay of AEFrame, if body executes fasted than the delay time.
 /// This module is not inherited from the base class, as it needs to be very fast, faster than the base class even,
 /// and without much of dependencies.
